<html><h1>The biggest show ever</h1>
<hr />
<body><h3>The start of an amazing experience</h3>
<p>The main thing that a 16 year old would want is to go to a concert, but not any ordinary concert, the biggest concert they could imagine with their favourite singer, and in this case it would be <q><strong><em>Drake</em></strong></q>. For now this singer is one of the most famous singers of the world, and it's coming here in <u>Italy</u>. All the teenagers want to go there, because it will be in Rome at <em>18:00/23:00</em> in Rome. The best thing of all is that this show will have millions of people, from every part of Italy. Every body is saying on social media,<q>OMG, WHAT A CONCERT THIS WILL BE</q>. This is everywhere:</p>
<blockquote>TikTok</blockquote>
<blockquote>Instagram</blockquote>
<blockquote>Twitter</blockquote>
<p><u>EVERYWHERE</u></p>
<h4>Preparing for the show</h4>
<p>To prepare for this <strong>5 hour </strong>show, you'll need to get much preperation to do. Get your <em>fire</em> clothes on, the perfect <em>shoes</em>on you have to be perfect to then have fun and get all messed up. <small>(as it should go)</small> Get all of your friends, to have fun and loose your voice the next day... The most important things to not bring are <strong>everything of value you could have that someone can get from you easily.</strong> The most important thing to bring is a <strong>phone and someone you can have fun easly.</strong> Maybe get a drink, some food before it starts, but not when the concert is running because 100% you'll loose it.</p>
<footer>An extra thing, <strong>DON'T EVER BRING A GENTLE EARING PERSON.</strong></footer>
<h2>IT'S THE DAY</h2>
<p>It's the first of July and the concert is here. <strong>Every</strong> social media has at least hundreds of comments or videos saying <q><em>it is the day, can't wait no longer.</em></q> The worst thing is that out there are people going crazy,<strong> shouting, throwing things, all kinds of things.</strong> Thinking that this concert will be in the same day this crazy people are going crazy is conserning. Being a teenage 14 year old it would be scary to go at that concert because you don't know who you can find. If people are going this crazy before the concert, WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE ACTUAL CONCERT</p>
<footer><em>30 minutes to the start of the concert</em></footer>
<p>Now people are even more crazier, people are <strong>CLIMIBING THE WALL</strong> to try and get in. Others are eating and chilling, but the amount of people there are is absurb, <em>1.5 million</em> of people FOR NOW. There are still other people coming out of cars. After <em>20 minutes</em> it seemed it was about to start as people entered. But not even getting to see where to go, <strong>Drake</strong> gets on the stage, everybody shouting <q><em>I LOVE YOU DRAKE</em></q>, <q><em>GRAB MY PHONE</em></q>, <q><em>DRAKEEE!!!!!</em></q>. People were insane. Finished the show the crazy people couldn't shout anymore for excitment, while the others could still talk, <small>(still without voice but still have some)</small>.</p>
<h4>Here the end happened</h4>
<p>Here is where everything went bad. After the show people started arguing with each other, started shouting will still the little voice they had, <q>MAN SHUT THE HELL UP</q>, <q> I DIDN'T DO NOTHING</q> but he was wrong, a lot of people were saying things nonsense because before the concert the crazy people taked <strong>illigal substances.</strong> Making much of a scene that after some time the police showed up and made a check to everybody who was still there if they had the illigal things. After some time they found something that would have get those people in jail. They found <del>drugs and some not authorized guns</del> but the ones that were just absurb having them.</p>
<footer>These people went to jail for a long time while the others understood what to do next time, <strong><u>just watch the concert from the TV.</u></strong></footer>
</body><h6><em><strong>In the end the things to understand are to go at whatever event you want but just be more carefull of your surroundings.</strong></em></h6>/html>
